# Custom Discord Rich Presence

Latest version: 2.1.0

- - -

## Intro

Custom Discord RPC (Rich Presence) is an application to create your own status for your Discord profile.
No, not that default single status but that epic status representing you 'playing' a game.

With this application, you can create your own status and show your friends something about you for example.

## Look of the application

This is how the application looks like:

![Main application](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857190128405184512/886555867640647690/unknown.png)

It looks really clean, it is easy to use and it is open-source which means you can edit the code whenever you want!

## What it will show on Discord

This is how my status looks like. As you can see, I am playing a 'game' with text I made by myself using the application. 

**You** can do this as well by downloading the latest release.

## How to use this application

I already made some documentations about how to use this application [here](https://github.com/babahgee/Custom-Discord-Rich-Presence/tree/master/Custom%20Discord%20Rich%20Presence/documentation). Feel free to read them so you know exactly what and how everything works.

## Tools I used for this app

Here a list of tools I used to build this application.

- Electron
- DiscordJS
- SocketIO
- Express
- Colors
- NodeNotifier

And of course a lot more.

I mostly did everything by myself, the design, the working of the app and *beans*.
