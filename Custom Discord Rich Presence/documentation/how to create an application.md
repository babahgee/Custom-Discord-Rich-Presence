## Developers site.

First step is to visit https://discord.com/developers/applications/. You may have to log in using
your Discord information to enter the Discord Developers Portal. 

You may see a screen like this.

In this screen, you have to enter the name of your application. The given name will also show on your Discord status, so be aware of that.
You can always change your application name.

## Application overview
Once you entered a name and pressed on 'click', you will see the following screen:

*I obviously marked my application it's id and public key for private reasons*

On your left, you will see a navigation menu including the tab 'Rich Presence'. Click on that button.

## Importing images

Once you clicked on the tab 'Rich Presence', you will see the following screen:

In this screen, you can upload images to your Discord application. Press 'Add images(s)' to upload images.

When you press the button and you selected an image, you will see the following input field:

In this, you will enter the name (key) for these images. You will use these keys in the RPC application. In my case, I used the name 'babah-gee'.

You can of course upload more images with different keys.

**NOTE: It may take a little while for Discord to process the images you have uploaded. Please wait patiently until they show up.**

## Getting ready to use the RPC application
Nice! You have succesfully setup your Discord application, now its ready to be used in the RPC application.

Now, go the tab 'General information'. And copy your application ID. You will use your application ID for the RPC application.
